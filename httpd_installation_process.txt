Installation of Apache HTTP 2.4 

Download link for HTTP server is as below. 

        http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#apache24 

Alternatively, HTTP installable is available in our shared fileserver path \\belgianrail.be\fileserver\TCS\MIDDLEWARE_TEAM\Softwares\Apache_HTTP2.4 

 

Pre-requisites  

 /app mount will be for middleware product installation directory. Make a directory named installable inside /app to place the installable file(httpd-2.4.41.tar) 

apr, pcr, gcc and apr-util-ldap packages need to be installed in server.  

 

Installation steps 

First, move installable to /app directory and, provide necessary permission before executing the tar.gz file. 

        chmod 777 httpd-2.4.41.tar.gz 

Run below command to extract the installable, 

        sudo tar -xvzf httpd-2.4.41.tar.gz  

Navigate to the HTTP installation directory. 

       cd /app/httpd-2.4.41 

Change the ownership of directory using below command. 

       sudo chown -R b2cforms:b2cforms httpd-2.4.41 

To configure run below command. 

       ./configure --prefix=/app/Apache2.4.41 

       PREFIX must be replaced with the filesystem path under which the server should be installed. 

       If PREFIX is not specified, it defaults to /usr/local/apache2. 

To compile and install the package run below commands respectively. 

       make 

   make install 

Navigate to prefix directory to customize httpd.conf file using below command. 

      sudo vi httpd.conf 

      By default, the HTTP server listener port is 80 but we have changed it to 8080 as we need root access if  any port is listing to port below 1024. 

 

 
 

 

Switch to ‘bin’ directory and run below command to test apache HTTP service. 

      To START --> ./apachectl -k start 

       To STOP   --> ./apachectl -k stop
